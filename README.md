# week-two-portfolio

The portfolio is very basic and contains very basic HTML and CSS. I will be building more on it as the course advances.

I have spent time this weekend researching HTML and CSS from both w3School and developer.mozilla.org.

I have found some items in this module a challenge as some parts of the code would not work for me. And I have spent my hours researching.
